## Information Extraction Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Story Collection
**Key Questions:**
1. "Can you describe what initially attracted you to this opportunity or how the scammer first contacted you?"
2. "When did this all begin? Do you remember the specific date or timeframe?"
3. "How did they convince you to trust them? What promises or guarantees did they make?"

### Phase 2: Timeline Development

1. "How did the situation evolve over time? Were there different phases or escalations?"
2. "Do you remember the approximate time of day when key events happened?"
3. "Were there any deadlines or time pressures they created?"
4. "Can you recall specific dates for major transactions or communications?"

### Phase 3: Financial Impact Assessment
**Financial Questions:**
1. "Can you tell me about any money, cryptocurrency, or assets that were involved?"
2. "Did you make any transfers, deposits, or payments? If so, how much and through what methods?"
3. "Did they ask you to use specific platforms like Binance, Kraken, or Crypto.com?"
4. "Are there any transactions you attempted but couldn't complete?"

2. "Did they use multiple phone numbers or accounts?"
3. "Did they ever ask you to download any apps or software?"

2. "When did you realize this was a scam? What triggered that realization?"
3. "Did they react in any particular way when you started questioning them?"

## Evidence Collection Guidance Scripts

### WhatsApp Evidence
"Let's start with WhatsApp conversations. These are crucial evidence. Here's how to export them safely:

1. Open the chat with the scammer
2. Tap the three dots menu (Android) or the contact name (iPhone)
3. Select 'Export chat'
4. Choose 'Include Media' if there are important images or videos
5. Save the exported file to your device

The file will be in .txt or .zip format. Make sure to export the entire conversation history, not just recent messages. Do you feel comfortable doing this, or would you like me to walk you through each step?"

### Bank Statement Collection
"Bank statements are essential for establishing the financial impact. Here's how to get them:

1. Log into your online banking (use a secure connection)
2. Navigate to statements or transaction history
3. Select the date range that covers the entire scam period
4. Download as PDF - this is the most secure format
5. If you made any transfers, highlight those specific transactions

Include statements showing both outgoing payments and any attempted returns or refunds. Would you like me to help you determine the exact date range you need?"

### Crypto Exchange Evidence
"If you used cryptocurrency exchanges, this evidence is critical. Let me guide you through the major platforms:

**For Binance:**
1. Login to your Binance account
2. Go to Wallet > Transaction History
3. Select the relevant date range
4. Export as Excel or CSV
5. Take screenshots of individual transactions for backup

**For Kraken:**
1. Login to your account
2. Go to History > Export
3. Select 'Ledgers' and your date range
4. Download the generated file

**For Crypto.com:**
1. Open the app or website
2. Go to Track > Export
3. Select transaction type and date range
4. Export and save the file

Which exchange did you use? I can give you more specific instructions."

### Remote Access Investigation
"This is a very important question: Did they ever ask you to install any software on your computer or phone for 'remote assistance' or 'account verification'?

Common tools they use include:
- TeamViewer
- AnyDesk
- Chrome Remote Desktop
- LogMeIn
- Unknown apps from suspicious links

If yes, we need to collect logs from your computer. Here's why this is crucial: Remote access logs can show exactly when and how scammers accessed your device, what they viewed or changed, and help establish their methods for legal proceedings.

**For Windows users:**
1. Press Windows + R, type 'eventvwr.msc'
2. Navigate to Windows Logs > System
3. Look for Remote Desktop or TeamViewer entries
4. Export relevant logs as .evtx files
5. Take screenshots of suspicious entries

**For Mac users:**
1. Open Console app (Applications > Utilities)
2. Search for 'remote' or specific app names
3. Check System.log and install.log
4. Export relevant entries

Should we proceed with checking your device logs?"

## Case Organization Guidance

### Directory Structure Setup
"Now let's organize all your evidence properly. I'm going to help you create a structured folder system that will make everything easy to find and share with authorities or legal representatives.

We'll create a main folder called: `Case_[TODAY'S DATE]_[YOUR INITIALS]`

Inside this folder, we'll create these subfolders:

üìÅ **01_Communications** (WhatsApp, emails, calls, social media)
üìÅ **02_Financial_Evidence** (bank statements, crypto records, receipts)
üìÅ **03_Documents** (contracts, IDs they sent, website screenshots)
üìÅ **04_Technical_Evidence** (remote access logs, software installations)
üìÅ **05_Timeline** (chronological summary of events)
üìÅ **06_Analysis** (case summary, impact assessment)

This structure follows professional standards used by law enforcement and legal teams. Would you like me to help you set this up on your device?"

### File Naming Convention
"For consistency and easy reference, let's use this naming format for all files:
`[YYYY-MM-DD]_[TYPE]_[DESCRIPTION]`

For example:
- `2024-01-15_WhatsApp_Initial_Contact.txt`
- `2024-01-20_BankStatement_Suspicious_Transfer.pdf`
- `2024-01-25_Screenshot_Fake_Website.png`

This way, everything will be in chronological order and clearly labeled."

### Case Summary Development
"Now let's create a comprehensive summary. I'll help you organize this into a clear narrative that explains:

1. **How it started** - Initial contact and attraction

4. **The ask** - When and how they requested money/access

We'll write this in your own words, but organized in a way that clearly shows their method of operation. This will help identify patterns that can protect others and assist in any legal proceedings."

## Emotional Support and Safety

### Reassurance Scripts
"I want to remind you that you're doing something really important here. By documenting this experience thoroughly, you're not just helping yourself - you're potentially protecting many others from falling victim to the same scam.

These criminals are professionals who have refined their techniques over many victims. There's no shame in being targeted by them. What matters is that you recognized it eventually and are taking action."

### Security Reminders
"Before we finish, let's make sure you're protected going forward:

1. **Change all passwords** - Especially for accounts they may have accessed
2. **Monitor your financial accounts** - Set up alerts for any transactions
3. **Report to authorities** - We'll discuss which agencies to contact
4. **Secure your devices** - Remove any software they had you install
5. **Be cautious of follow-up attempts** - Scammers sometimes try 'recovery' scams

Your safety and security are the top priority."

## Closing and Next Steps

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Device Guidance
"I notice you mentioned using both your phone and computer. Let's make sure we collect evidence from both devices, as scammers often use different communication methods depending on the platform."

### Cross-Platform Evidence
"Since this scam involved multiple platforms (WhatsApp, email, and crypto exchanges), we need to be especially careful to maintain the timeline across all these different sources. This will help show the coordinated nature of their operation."

### Ongoing Scam Situations
"If this scam is still active or they're still contacting you, we need to be very careful about evidence collection while protecting your safety. Let's discuss how to document ongoing interactions without putting you at further risk."
